Visualization
==================

This folder contains notebooks demonstrating the various plotting functions in sidpy.

Some of the functions in ``sidpy.viz.plot_utils`` fill gaps in the default matplotlib package,
others weredeveloped for scientific applications.
These functions have been developed
to substantially simplify the generation of high quality figures for journal publications.
